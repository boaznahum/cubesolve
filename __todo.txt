When quiting in middle of solver, it fails due to unxepcted state.
  Need some how to throw ApplicationStopped exception


enable/disable markers on cube
draw boxes instead of quad for cube facets

+++ bug: als optimized should consider slices 2R != R

Count 90 movements and not cycles
Generalize slice walking use in communicator
Optimize movements in centers
In even search first /second pair with maximum colors
Compare counts
Fix scramble also to invert×ª  and multiple and generate sub lists

# try to optimize, work less on B

Before centers counting, size 6, scramble 5, #ops=532 , size 8 1326
#  after counting only on first face(without opposite) 6 -> 546(bug) ! -> 8->1288
