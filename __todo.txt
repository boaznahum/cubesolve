# BUG CORNER SWAP -Scramble 4, size 8

When quiting in middle of solver, it fails due to unxepcted state.
  Need some how to throw ApplicationStopped exception



Generalize slice walking use in communicator
Optimize movements in centers

Fix scramble also to invert×ª  and multiple and generate sub lists

# try to optimize, work less on B

Bug, solver count on scramble is not reproducible, is alg is ? -yes, see test test_scramble_repeatable.py
  the problem is probably in solver, need to check if some queries/serach are in set, sol order os changes
