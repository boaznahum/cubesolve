Generalize slice walking and use in communicator

Feature: Fix scramble also to invert and multiple and generate sub lists, but preserve current version


BUG:   Slice on R vertical wrong direction !!!

!!! why big block doesn't cause tracker replacement ? like in whole slice

Feature: swap complete slices - Done, but only destination zero slices
Feature: Keyboard history

Bug: self annotation cause delay in animation ?

Code: Move face tackers to seperated file

Optimize: clone don't need to clone facets attributes, measure and fix
          remove slice and part c/f attributes

Feature: viewer should be automatically detect change sin shadowing mode and reset itself, not as to today keyboard handler reset
  view after each shadow change

Optimize: centers should start with front, and minimize movements

Optimize : improve face tracker, they should search 4 points only !!!
    Also edge can search two points only
    Also in annotation - search only 4/2 points
