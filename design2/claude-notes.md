# Claude Notes - OpenGL Model Documentation Project

This file contains my working notes and instructions to myself during this documentation project.

---

## Priority Instructions

1. **FIRST**: Read `human-notes.md` carefully before doing any documentation work
2. The human developer has expressed that I don't fully understand the model - take this seriously
3. Ask clarifying questions when uncertain rather than making assumptions

## Current Status

- Project just started
- Awaiting human notes and background information

## My Understanding Gaps

(To be filled as I identify areas where my understanding is incomplete)

## Documentation Progress

(Track documentation work here)

## Questions for Human

(List questions that arise during documentation)
