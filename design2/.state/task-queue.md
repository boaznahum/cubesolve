## Phase 1: Model Research & Documentation

### 1.1 Initial Research (NOT STARTED)
- [ ] Explore model folder structure
- [ ] Identify core model classes
- [ ] Map class relationships
- [ ] Understand Part, Slice, Face concepts
- [ ] Understand position IDs
- [ ] Understand color IDs
- [ ] Understand rotation mechanics

### 1.2 Document Core Concepts (NOT STARTED)
- [ ] Create model architecture diagram
- [ ] Document Part class and its methods
- [ ] Document which methods are phase-dependent
- [ ] Document Slice concept
- [ ] Document Face concept
- [ ] Document rotation/transformation logic

### 1.3 Validate & Align (NOT STARTED)
- [ ] Cross-check documentation with existing docstrings
- [ ] Update any inconsistent docstrings
- [ ] Add links between docs and code
