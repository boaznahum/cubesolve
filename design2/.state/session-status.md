# Session Status

## Current Phase
**Documentation Phase** - Creating visual documentation

## Last Updated
2025-12-06

## Current Focus
ID system deep analysis COMPLETE. Created visual diagram documentation.

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Created design2 folder structure
- [x] Created human-notes.md and claude-notes.md
- [x] Captured two-phase architecture insight (part methods validity)
- [x] Created .state mechanism
- [x] Reformatted human-notes.md
- [x] Read README.md - captured architecture overview
- [x] Planned research phase
- [x] Explored model/ package - mapped all classes
- [x] Read and understood: Cube.py, Part.py, Face.py, Edge.py, Corner.py, Center.py
- [x] Read and understood: _part_slice.py (EdgeWing, CenterSlice, CornerSlice)
- [x] Understood the ID system (fixed_id, position_id, colors_id)
- [x] Connected two-phase insight to is3x3 property chain
- [x] Verified ID understanding against solver code (NxNEdges, L1Cross, Tracker)
- [x] Created `model-id-system.md` with visual diagrams
- [x] Updated task-queue.md with remaining questions

## In Progress
None - awaiting human review

## Pending (see task-queue.md for details)
- [ ] Document rotation mechanics (Face.rotate, Slice class)
- [ ] Understand `right_top_left_same_direction` in Edge
- [ ] Create model architecture diagram (class hierarchy visual)
- [ ] Document solvers
- [ ] Document presentation layer

## Blockers
None currently

## Documentation Created
- `design2/model-id-system.md` - Visual diagrams explaining ID system

## Notes for Next Session
- ID system is fully documented with diagrams
- Understanding verified against solver usage patterns
- Remaining: rotation mechanics, class diagrams, solver docs
