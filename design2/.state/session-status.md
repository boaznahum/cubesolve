# Session Status

## Current Phase
**Research Phase** - Understanding the model

## Last Updated
2025-12-06

## Current Focus
Deep dive into model classes, especially:
- Cube composition
- Faces
- Parts (Corner, Edge, Center) and derived classes
- Slices and derived classes

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Created design2 folder structure
- [x] Created human-notes.md and claude-notes.md
- [x] Captured two-phase architecture insight (part methods validity)
- [x] Created .state mechanism
- [x] Reformatted human-notes.md
- [x] Read README.md - captured architecture overview
- [x] Planned research phase

## In Progress
- [ ] Explore model/ package - map all classes

## Pending
- [ ] Document Cube class and composition
- [ ] Document Face class
- [ ] Document Part classes (Corner, Edge, Center)
- [ ] Document Slice classes
- [ ] Understand position IDs vs color IDs
- [ ] Document rotation mechanics
- [ ] Document solvers
- [ ] Document presentation layer
