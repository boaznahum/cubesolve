# Session Status

## Current Phase
**Research Phase** - Understanding the model

## Last Updated
2025-12-06

## Current Focus
Initial model exploration COMPLETE. Ready for detailed documentation.

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Created design2 folder structure
- [x] Created human-notes.md and claude-notes.md
- [x] Captured two-phase architecture insight (part methods validity)
- [x] Created .state mechanism
- [x] Reformatted human-notes.md
- [x] Read README.md - captured architecture overview
- [x] Planned research phase
- [x] Explored model/ package - mapped all classes
- [x] Read and understood: Cube.py, Part.py, Face.py, Edge.py, Corner.py, Center.py
- [x] Read and understood: _part_slice.py (EdgeWing, CenterSlice, CornerSlice)
- [x] Understood the ID system (fixed_id, position_id, colors_id)
- [x] Connected two-phase insight to is3x3 property chain

## In Progress
- [ ] Create formal documentation based on insights

## Pending
- [ ] Document rotation mechanics (Face.rotate, Slice class)
- [ ] Understand `right_top_left_same_direction` in Edge
- [ ] Document solvers
- [ ] Document presentation layer

## Blockers
None currently

## Notes for Next Session
- Model structure is now well understood
- Key insight: Fixed parts, rotating colors
- Key insight: Three ID types and their relationships
- Key insight: is3x3 property determines phase validity
- Next: Create formal documentation or investigate remaining questions
