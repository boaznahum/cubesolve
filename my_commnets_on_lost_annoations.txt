you find are wrong, this is not a cube manipulation, it is type of query, so actaully we are not modifying the cube
like in roate_and_check methods
in puth case we need to impove the mecani, have one method to perfrom logrithm ad undo it, we have such mehod in operator !!
cube.application.commands.Operator.Operator.with_query_restore_state
 ... the we set query mode to true, we need to find all such places,
but it is not related to annotation problem, becuase the final efffect doesnt chnage the cube, and we dont want to annotatet it
