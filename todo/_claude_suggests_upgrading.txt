I need to discuss the situation with you. Your codebase heavily uses deprecated OpenGL 1.x functions that pyglet 2.0 no longer supports. Here are your options:

  Option 1: Revert to Pyglet 1.5 ⭐ (Recommended for now)

  - ✅ Everything works immediately
  - ✅ Removes unused glooey dependency
  - ✅ Uses PyOpenGL for GLU functions
  - ❌ Miss out on pyglet 2.x performance improvements

  Option 2: Continue debugging Pyglet 2.0

  - Try to make PyOpenGL work with pyglet's context
  - Uncertain if it will work reliably
  - Already spent significant time troubleshooting

  Option 3: Major refactoring to Modern OpenGL

  - Migrate from display lists → VBOs/VAOs
  - Migrate from immediate mode → shaders
  - Huge undertaking (weeks/months of work)

  My recommendation: Revert to pyglet 1.5.31 + PyOpenGL for now. This gets you a working upgrade (removed glooey, added PyOpenGL) without breaking changes. Later, you could plan a gradual migration to modern OpenGL.

  Should I revert to pyglet 1.5?
