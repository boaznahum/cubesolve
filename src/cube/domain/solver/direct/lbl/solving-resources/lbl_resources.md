# Story 
  3:12


# U R U' L' U R' U' L
# try replace L with [2]M
U R U' [2]M' U R' U' [2]M
This bring up to Right


11:50 he start more examples:

# But how up to left ?
14:36, he says
U' L' ...
# maybe h means 3 corenrs 
Alternative (Clockwise Cycle): 
L' U R U' L U R' U' ? so I tried

# isten again  - works
U' L' U [2]M' U' L U [2]M

# explanation
#explain - this the left hand algorithm that leave left corner
# M rotate with L against R so when he R, he means [2]M' !!!
#U' L' U R U' L U R'
