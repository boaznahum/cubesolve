1. add animation to edge commutator
2. Count operations i solver
   3. check up color before rotation
3. dead code
4. scount doest count helper solver
5. On centers solving, the cube is roated with no need if all solved


# too many rotations
scramble, solve l2 centers, try L3C or L3x, now it rotate and rotate for nothing
