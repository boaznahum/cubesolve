# Solver TODOs

- Finish orchestrator to handle 3x3 solvers that cannot detect parity errors (see __branch_state.md in this package)
- Make sure all queries use new context manager in Operator that suspends animation and undoes operations
- Kociemba test fails due to inability to handle parity - work on abstract_reducer addresses this
