# PEP 561 marker file - indicates this package supports type checking
#
# Why this file exists:
# - mypy src/cube    -> Path mode: reads files directly, no marker needed
# - mypy -p cube     -> Package mode: uses import system, requires py.typed
#
# Without this file, "mypy -p cube" skips the package assuming it's untyped.
# This marker tells mypy: "this package includes type information"
