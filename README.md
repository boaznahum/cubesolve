# Python Big Cube Solver
Yet another Big Cube solver
Python

  Don't search for sophisticated algorithm, my challenge was exactly the contrary - to mimic the way I solve the cube – a very beginner solver. So, when animation is turn on – you even can see how the cube does a whole rotate just to put the parts in front face – the way I know to solve.
