# Python Big Cube Solver
Yet another Big Cube solver
Python

  Don't search for sophisticated algorithm, my challenge was exactly the contrary - to mimic the way I solve the cube – a very beginner solver. So, when animation is turn on – you even can see how the cube does a whole rotate just to put the parts in front face – the way I know to solve.
  
  

## Installing and running



  Better to create a virtual enviroment, then
```  
  python -m pip install -U -r requirements.txt
  python main_g.py
  
```

## Keyboard


### Controlling view 
    Ctlr/Alt X, Y, Z - Rotate cube over X, Y , Z Axis
### Modes
    o - Turn animation on/off
    Num Pad +/- Change Animation speed
    +/- Cube size

### Rotating
    R, L, F, B, U, B  - As suauls - rotate faces
    X, Y, Z - Entire cube over R, U and F 
    M, E, S - Middle slice over R, **D** and F

### Scrambling 

    0 to 6 -  Scramble with diffrent random seed, yet no good scramble agorithm


### Solving
